# Day 20

This stream was easier to follow than the last. I'm starting to gain some intuition on his style.





## Archtecture wise

I'm deciding to cause some more complexity leakage to the API layers..  

I'll restrict it to on-demand but I want to have the engine have configurable options modern games tend to have, if I find it fullfilling todo so I may also expose some configuration for aspects of the engine, most games do not allow the user to mess with.

This was something I wanted to do with my previous attempt and constructing a "probeable" game engine, however, that attempt failed because I kept the API granularity far to high resolution.. and it was *Modern C++* which is the project I learned the hardway was not worth the mental effort to maintain or engage with.  
(I also dove straight into graphics programming with Vulkan... making my own vulkan wrapper library... At least I learned a good chunk of the driver's graphics pipeline..)

Debug visualization for the audio was great.
