# Day 42

I decided to generate the vectors since I wanted f32 and s32 vectors. However, I didn't want to use templates.  
I ended up messing aroudn with templates a bit for the `Zero(type)` macro which is just an alt for `type {}`.  
Pattern is useful for other constant inits though (if I want to do it that way...)

Found bugs in gencpp which was nice!
Compressing the code with vector abstraction was nice, hopefuly these pixel will soon as well...
