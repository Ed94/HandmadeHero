# Day 21

So I learned today the good reason why he doesn't use static variables; So that when he makes this library dynamically loaded we don't lose the state of the game on reload.  

This day was extremely gratifying to get working.

I went the extra mile than what Casey did and allow for name mangled symbols (for both clang and msvc).  
It took a few more steps than his solution but I get to keep the eronomics of namespaces.

After the linker finishes emitting, I use the build script to parse the .map file and extract the decorated symbols I need to load in the platform layer. Those are exported to a file called `handmade_engine.symbols` and then in the platform layer I load them up using an enum as the lookup table for the line the symbol will be in the file. From there its just loading up the symbol with GetProcAddress!
