# Day 30

Tile map stuff is looking alright. Doing my best to not clean-up the code as Casey pleads in the vods.

I would have perferred if he didn't just do one tilemap at a time and instead I would have had the current tile map and surrounding loaded at the same time (He might do this in the future). Since were aren't constrained memory wise like the old machines, we could have those loaded as well and it would make the management of the tilemaps easier (possibly...).

Looking foward to when he introduces a proper vector space for the positioning.
