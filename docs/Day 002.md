# Day 2

Pretty smooth so far, modular header library is showing its limitations...

I have enough practice messsing with forwards and library linkage now that it wasn't much of a show stopper at least. All the mess is quarantined in the in win32.h and so far it looks like it will be enough to keep it all there.

I added extra stuff in `grime.h`, `macros.h`, and `types.h` that he will either go over soon from my vauge memory last time I just watched him (instead of doing) + stuff from gencpp's version of the zpl library.
