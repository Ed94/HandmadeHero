Him doing replay save states at the platform layer is causing issues for me...

I'm going to most likely end up doing two categories of save states, one for engine level and one for platform level.

The engine level can just store it in the memory struct, and the game memory can just stay where it is.
I want to use the same "save state" slots for both engine and game since there is no need different memory buckets for that. They will at worst case be ofcourse the size of engine's memory block.

So if there is 4, we are looking at 5x the actual memory size. This is fine for now since the engine block is 2 gigs.

Since engine manages the memory of game and editor (when editor exists), restoring its state will also restore the game and editor state.
