# Day 23

Getting state saving was nice.

I decided to expose the file inteface through the platform API permanently, so that I can use it for other things later on.

I'm changing my varaible naming convention in structus from UpperCamel to lower_snake_case. 
I realized that semantic highlighting covers any contextual issues along with editor intellisense.
Even at worst case with public/protected/private specifers intellisense covers it.

So I'm going with the option that keeps my naming convention consistent and more flexible to use with Casey's exploratory programming style.
