# Day 39

My `draw_bitmap` proc has been already setup to have the position specified
from the assumped position of the center of the image.  
Its how I'm used to anchoring images by default so thats why I decided to go with it.

Casey however is using the corner however...  
and then is doing some offset alignment based on what he sees for the coordinates on GIMP..

I decided to hand calibrate the alignment by eye. Since I already have it centered on X, the `align_x` could  
stay zeroed for now and all I needed to do was align_y.

I also did not do the difference using a `tile_map_diff` like he did,
I just returned a tile_map_position and switch the map coodinates to be signed 
(which tbh is fine I'll just adjust the math later when I need to).

I'm assuming it won't matter because the tile map setup we currently have is before he revamps the project with proper
vector math data structures, and he might switch to signed coordinates for them in the stream.
