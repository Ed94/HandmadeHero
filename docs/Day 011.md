# Day 11

Architecture discussion was great. Did some diagramming of it.

I'm going to use a 3 layer approach to the architecture:

* Platform
* Engine
* Game (Handmade)

It will be style 2 so they each will provide a service to the layer below it and platform will provide an API to both engine and game.
