# Day 12

This day was a mess to follow along.

> Always write the usage code first if you can, when designing something like an API.

Casey decided to do some heavy hits the audio (makes sense) due to the use of DirectSound.
I'm going to preserve his implmentation as is for the most part since I rather keep things simple so that this project actually gets done.

> Only introduce added complexity when you need it.

There are two reasons you allow for a more complex interface, you ***NEED*** the feature. It actually is required for the project to have for the UX to preserve the user-level features. Or, there is a performance bottleneck that you need to address.
