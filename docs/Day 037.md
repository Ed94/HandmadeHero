# Day 37

I went ahead and did some extra stuff.  
My "hero" is a mojito bmp for now. I'll eventually do something else for it.  
I also added incremental build support for the codegen metaprograms.

I originally wanted to make the assets on the fly (just as a break from the code),  
but decided to just use his assets as this series is already going to take forever.

I have the assets mapped to an "offical" directory within content, however they'll be naturally ignored on the repo.
