# Day 1

Project initially setup. Followed the video and the book.

I went extra since I already have a perferred setup I've recently grown accoustmed to and I'm going to take advantage of the metaprogramming library I've recently made for myself. Although I doubt it'll see much action...

I'll be keeping the code pretty C like as Casey does in the series. Main purpose is to be able to use whitebox.
